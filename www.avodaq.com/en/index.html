<h3>Instinct for Success</h3>
<h2>Our instinct – your success</h2>
</div>
<p><span class="intro">We have a passion for technology and a unique sense of subtlety. From the wide range of what is available on the IT market, we develop solutions that will assure you maximum success with certified quality.</span></p>
<p>Meeting a new challenge successfully requires two things: expertise and instinct. We do not immediately adopt every new “innovation” without a critical review. This ensures that our customers gain a genuine benefit.</p>
<p>This is why we invest massively in quality assurance measures. We do not have a single ‘best’, but a team of the best. Young engineers go through an intensive six-month training period before they are carefully introduced to real projects. Our colleagues regularly sit for new tests that certify their development – including the most recognized and most difficult tests for system engineers to become a Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE). We have the highest proportion of high- and highest-level Cisco-certified staff worldwide.</p>
<p>However, the technical implementation of a solution is only one side of the coin. We also work according to certified standards (PRINCE2 and ITIL) in project management and in our service sector. Here too, our specialists take the corresponding exams.</p>

      <p>The remote expert is always there when everyone else has gone home. Through a very high quality video telephony, client and expert come together, building a sense of intimicy and trust across the distance. The expert pitches in – and, using special software can take over the controls of input and output devices at the remote site, such as a desk in an agency or bank, in order to fully serve the client.</p>

      <p>Cities grow – and so do the challenges facing them. How can scarce resources such as energy and water be managed more efficiently? Or waste products? Smart IT solutions help to answer the big questions of a big city. Finding a parking spot, for example. In some cities today, motorists nearing their destination are guided by the navigation system directly to the nearest parking lot. How smart is this.</p>

      <p>Must an IT system in the data center and workplace run at full power at night and on weekends? In a ‘smart’ building, network connections and phones can be switched into energy saving mode as soon the office lights go out. And once many offices are no longer staffed, servers can also be run at reduced performance. In summary, a significant energy saving potential is created. Intelligent buildings: a green investment.</p>

<h2>IT needs Change Management</h2>
</div>
<p><span class="intro">Only if people accept and use IT at the workplace can they fully develop its ability to enhance efficiency. Change management motivates individuals and ensures that teams work better together.</span></p>
<p>Boosting efficiency: easy-to-use communication means are no longer good enough for that. Only together, with actively practiced change management, can the desired effects and a level of cooperation, characterized by greater precision and confidence, be achieved.</p>
<p>Change management requires three steps: Understanding, recognition, and application. <br>This is precisely the path we go down with our tried and tested methods and means. To master those steps we explain how to use video, telephone, chat and online meetings in the context of your in-company procedures and activities.</p>
<p>This aids colleagues in a team to create the change together – and to fully exploit the strengths of their new communication solution.</p>
<p>Every now and then the well known ‘kick’ is needed to get it up and running – but then it runs like clockwork!</p>

      <p><span class="intro">Success is not a solo affair; it is the work of a community. Collaboration aims to improve cooperation within the team to keep technical possibilities of “how-where-what and always keeping communications open".</span></p>
<p>Our collaboration solutions consist of different combinable modules, such as telephone, chat, video, etc. They function reliably and are easy to use. With active change management we introduce the devices and applications to colleagues. We explain the benefits and show the combination of work and technology using practical examples.</p>
<p>Is a phone still even a phone? Yes and no. The technology, which the user needs not see or even grasp, is Voice over IP (VoIP) with a telephone system, which is implemented as software on a server in the data center. Since the late 1990s it has almost completely replaced classic ISDN or analog technology, in only 15 years.</p>
<p>The evolution in the end-device market continues: with smartphones, softphones, tablet-computer-phones and video phones. Concepts such as Bring Your Own device (BYOD) are already going in another direction.</p>

<p>Security gaps threaten the functionality of the IT infrastructure, jeopardize the smooth operation and open the doors for extortion. They can even undermine the existence of entire companies.</p>
<p>IT security requires several steps: Recognizing and understanding, identifying and evaluating current protective measures, and of course applying them consistently. We advise you on the technical side and can help you create awareness of threats among your employees. IT security is enterprise security and goes far beyond the technical components. Knowing the dangers, we can plan a security concept that is tailored to your company together with you, and implement the results with the help of our experts. IT security is and will continue to be the key factor in the advancing digitalization process.</p>

							<h2>Cisco Case Study about our video call solution CARY</h2>
				<div class="news-main-text"><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daniel Casado, our Manager Digital Business, created our video call system CARY together with his team and the support of Cisco during the first Lockdown in 2020. CARY is a product that connects nursing home residents to their families virtually.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>The development of CARY</h3>
<p>The project at a glance: the initial idea was grounded on personal experiences of Daniel Casado himself. Shortly after, this idea was turned into a serious project. During a short period of time, the team developed a first demo version of CARY. Together with Cisco, 6 care facilities in Hamburg, Berlin and Gießen were provided with video call devices like the Cisco DX80 or the Cisco Webex Desk Pro, which thereby were carefully tested.</p>

<p>Source: Katharinenhof am Hirschpark</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>One common goal</h3>
<p>What made this project so special is the teamwork of many people with different levels of technical knowledge. Together they had one aim: to create a concept that makes communication between two parties as simple as possible.<br>The following user feedback was consistently positive. As Daniel Casado stated: “The best feedback we got was from a nursing facility in Berlin, where they just wrote two lines in an email: “The device worked great. Everyone cried.””</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Cisco Case Study</h3>
<p>Cisco dedicated an own <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/de_de/about/case-studies-customer-success-stories/avodaq-story.html?_lrsc=2f9ab3b8-8390-4d28-87e0-567d896bfcbc&amp;dtid=osolin001080" target="_blank">case study</a> to our CARY project. Subject of this case study is an <a href="https://upshotstories.com/stories/connection-and-care-designing-the-future-of-accessible-video-communication" target="_blank">interview with Daniel Casado</a>, in which he illustrates the development of CARY. Thereby he refers to the needed technical activities as well as the interaction and cooperation between all the persons involved.</p>

							<h2>avodaq Donation Marathon: Strong together against Corona</h2>
				<div class="news-main-text"><p>Anyone can help, that’s what we thought. And that’s how a company donation to the <a href="https://www.kinderprojekt-arche.de/">Arche e.V.</a> has become a company-wide donation project within a very short time.</p>
<p>The idea: The money donated privately by colleagues for a Corona charity project of their choice would be doubled by avodaq. The concept not only led to great motivation internally, but was also very well received in the business environment. So well, in fact, that the donations were once again increased. As a result, a considerable amount of money has been raised, which will benefit a large number of really great charity projects. THANK YOU all for the commitment!</p>

Under the topic "Borderless, Security &amp; Mobility and Data Center" the workshop offered a lot of space for critical consideration of new technologies such as SD-Access, SD-WAN and ACI. The exchange of experiences between our experts was also not neglected.

							<h2>Next stop future</h2>
				<div class="news-main-text"><p>No broadband, few services, too much traffic - Germany's cities have some catching up to do in terms of digitization. This is where the &nbsp;<a href="https://stadtinbewegung.de/" target="_blank">"Stadt in Bewegung"</a>&nbsp;initiative comes in. Six companies are supporting cities in digitizing their infrastructure and developing future-oriented services. With the help of digital technologies, the quality of life is to be improved - for example through better traffic planning, integrated mobility services and advanced lighting. However, individual solutions are only the beginning - avodaq as an IT architect links individual applications and provides the necessary infrastructure. Because: IT silos don't get us anywhere!<br>In the coming weeks, the initiative will make its offers and services in various cities "experienceable" in the truest sense of the word in the form of a high-tech bus and discuss the potential of the digitized city with leading politicians and experts. The kick-off in Dortmund took place yesterday together with the Lord Mayor Ullrich Sierau.</p></div>

				<div class="news-main-text"><p>Kubernetes, Microservices at AWS, Ansible vs. Terraform, Dynatrace, React, Swagger...the technologies in software development are diverse and complex. The avodaq software development team used the intensive exchange at the annual department workshop in Hamburg to keep an overview. During the last two days, some of the technologies were demonstrated directly in the respective live system and then put to the test. Always with regard to the question: Can they be used reasonably at avodaq and if so - how? At the end of the workshop, the colleagues directly tested the ordering software on the tablet during running sushi.</p></div>

							<h2>Trainee program instead of skills shortage</h2>
				<div class="news-main-text"><p>We at avodaq are of the opinion that only well-founded training can help against a shortage of skilled workers. That's why this year's trainee programme was launched at the beginning of March. <br>In the next 11 weeks, basic training in theory and practice on the topics of networking, security, data centers and collaboration is planned. A milestone will be the CCNA certification. After 12 weeks in the classroom, the seriousness of life begins for the four - under the supervision and guidance of mentors they enter the day-to-day business as implementation engineers . In our trainee program, we rely on personal support from avodaq employees and real hardware practice - we don't offer off-the-shelf courses or simulations in software. The goal: highly qualified employees and colleagues who fit into our team!</p></div>

<h2>Update on Trainee Program</h2>
<p>Time flies. It has been already a month since our trainees became part of the avodaq family. Everyone has settled in Frankfurt where they share apartments and test various Äppelwoiwirtschaften together. It is nice to hear that the guys are inspired by the great team spirit at avodaq. Currently they are in the theoretical part of their training, this runs until mid-January 2018. Thereafter, the six trainees will spread to our branches in whole Germany. The boys are looking forward to everything that is yet to come and are eager to get started on working with new technologies in the next step.</p>

<h2>avodaq Trainee Program Starts in Frankfurt</h2>
<p>This week saw the start of the year's avodaq trainee program. On Monday, we welcomed six new colleagues in our Frankfurt office. After they were officially welcomed, they received a first introduction in general topics. The theoretical part of the training will be completed within the next three and a half months in Frankfurt, followed by the practical part in the respective branch offices. The versatile professional workshops are carried out by internal experts of various specializations, some of whom themselves once started as trainees at avodaq. We are looking forward to the team's growth and wish our new colleagues a great start!</p>

<h2>avodaq Starting at the Velothon Berlin</h2>
<p>Yesterday, the Velothon Berlin marked another sporty highlight for avodaq. In the tenth anniversary of the cycling race, some 11,000 amateur cyclists took part in the race to prove themselves on tracks over 60, 120 or 180 kilometers. avodaq did not participate with the full team, but the participation paid off in any case. The atmosphere and the circuit were great and we are already looking forward to the Cyclassics in Hamburg.</p>

<h2>avodaq obtains accreditation as Master Cloud Builder</h2>
<p>It's official: As of yesterday, avodaq is Cisco Master Cloud Builder partner! This highest certification, which is based on the classical gold partner, is extremely demanding and complex. Only very few IT companies dare to meet this challenge. Next to avodaq, there are only three partners in Germany who have achieved this status. avodaq CEO Andreas Kusch is enthusiastic about the great team performance and said: "We have learned a lot and we have established processes and expertise within the company." The future of the data center lies in the hybrid cloud architecture. As a Master Cloud Builder, we have proven and certified the expertise that our customers can expect and further strengthens our long-term partnership with Cisco.</p>

<h2>avodaq Supports Girl’s and Boy’s Day</h2>
<p>On today’s Girl’s and Boy’s Day, we had interested pupils visiting our Berlin and Hamburg offices. In Hamburg, Lian looked over the shoulders of our staff and got an impression of what the individual departments at avodaq do. Lian is an 11-year-old 6th grader. He would like to become a palaeontologist, but after today he could also imagine working with avodaq. We are pleased to give curious children the opportunity to get an insight into our future-oriented IT industry. Maybe they will be our future colleagues!</p>

<h2>How Digitization Influences Recruitment Processes in Asia</h2>
<p>“How can digital working environments improve talent recruitment from Asia for German enterprises?” — This was the topic at today's panel discussion at the “Talent Pool Asia” event, where avodaq CEO Andreas Kusch took part and talked about his experience. The conclusion was that it is not just about the perfect technical prerequisites. The successful creation of international teams requires an understanding of each of the cultures involved. Change begins with ourselves. This year, Google Germany GmbH also supported the event series, which was first initiated in 2014 by the OAV — German Asia-Pacific Business Association and the Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h2>avodaq Sponsor of the "Formula 1 in Schools" Technology Competition</h2>
<p>On 11<sup>th&nbsp;</sup> February 2017, the state final of the &nbsp;<a href="https://www.f1inschools.de/" target="_blank">"Formula 1 in Schools"</a>&nbsp; technology competition was held in the German city of Hamburg. The GhostRacers team (from the Matthias-Claudius-Gymnasium advanced secondary school) sponsored by avodaq was able to impress the jury and achieve third place in the Junior category. The team was also presented with a special award for the Best Junior Stand! The competition requires participants to use state-of-the-art technology to develop miniature Formula 1 racing cars, for example by producing some vehicle components on 3D printers. It provides school pupils with an insight into the fields of product development, technology and science and introduces them to the different career paths available in the world of technology. We place a special focus on supporting the further education and training of young talents in the classic STEM subjects and are therefore extremely pleased with both this initiative and our team's excellent achievement!</p>

<h2>Cisco Partner Summit puts Customer Success at the Center of Attention</h2>
<p>This week, our CEO Andreas Kusch and Johanna Ahrens, manager of the Change Management department, attended the Cisco Partner Summit in San Francisco and have gathered exciting impressions. This year Cisco emphasized the benefit for the customer, the customer success which arises from the implementation of various IT architectures, and made it the central subject. In the future, the customers will be advised even more intensively to utilize the full range of functions of their Cisco solutions. avodaq has already been doing this for 4 years and thus, is regarded as a forerunner among the Cisco partners.</p>

<h2>The Power of Connection</h2>
<p>In the past the Refugee First Response Center (&nbsp;<a href="http://refugeefirstresponsecenter.com/" target="_blank">RFRC</a>&nbsp;) has already been in the spotlight of media attention.

<h2>Change equals chance?</h2>
</div>
<p><span class="intro">Change is constant in the IT world, but not every change brings the promised benefits. It is the most relevant changes that must be identified and quickly made use of for the benefit of the customer.</span></p>
<p>Megatrends have a considerable impact on the world we live in. Almost always, they are related to the developments in the IT industry. Our expertise and what we do make us more than just an attentive observer of these developments.</p>
<p>Our tasks include comprehending the changes in detail and advising our clients on impacts and measures. Here it is often down to instinct, a sense for where the wind is blowing, which helps us realize what impact the changes will bring. Currently we are focusing on three areas of development: IT Cloud as a service, Industry 4.0, and Bring Your Own device.</p>

<h3>Cloud – IT as a service</h3>
<h2>Mobilize your IT</h2>
</div>
<p><span class="intro">The “Cloudisation" of IT has changed how we do things, and it has affected the IT infrastructure as well. The variety of offers accessible over the Internet that can be called up on mobile devices poses growing challenges to the IT sector.</span></p>
<p>From the point of view of the end device, the origin of an IT service can no longer be recognized by the user. Quite naturally the user takes advantage of its data and applications, apparently from “the cloud”, as and when he wishes. For him, the only thing that matters, is that everything can be accessed quickly when and where it is required. For IT, that means increasing agility and flexibility – while steadily lowering costs.</p>
<p>The technical possibilities are immense: Server and client virtualization, broadband Internet access, location-independent data center architectures, laptops, tablets and smartphones, HTML portals and social media. All of these making rapid inroads into today's enterprise IT and changing the demands in this area.<br>Frequent vocabulary that comes up in the forums and discussions – such as public-, private-, trusted-, German-, inter-, and hybrid-clouds – makes it difficult to gain an overview. Which is important? Which is correct? We discuss with our customers the benefits of a cloud solution for their business and advise them on what cloud structures could be used.</p>

<h3>Industry 4.0</h3>
<h2>The revolution in production</h2>
</div>
<p><span class="intro">Many experts believe we are standing on the threshold of a new industrial revolution. IT and the Internet allow a new, highly flexible, high-volume production with a strong customization of products.</span></p>
<p>German Chancellor Merkel has recognized this: "It is important that we build on the ‘Industry 4.0’ platform." IT is the basic prerequisite for that, for automating processes and procedures in the Internet of things to a new level of quality. Self-optimization, self-configuration and self-diagnostics are features of a development that demonstrate how intelligent the production of tomorrow will be.</p>
<p>We at avodaq have grasped the possibilities inherent in Industry 4.0 from very early on and are prepared to advise our customers comprehensively from the IT perspective.</p>

<h3>Bring your own device</h3>
<h2>My IT is your IT</h2>
</div>
<p><span class="intro">If IT pleases those who use it and rely on it, then it’s successful. This success is demonstrated by a growing number of intensive IT-users. Companies are also seeing staff bringing their own devices to the workplace – what risks and opportunities does this bring?</span></p>
<p>Convenient shopping around the clock in online stores, finding answers from an infinite wealth of information with a single click, keeping up social contacts in the private network – people have grown accustomed to using IT anytime, anywhere, comfortably and easily. And so they bring their "private IT solution" to their workplaces as well, because they don’t want to miss out on how useful they are.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the employer, work done on the private end-unit naturally seems practical and efficient. But thinking of it in terms of cost alone is a bit shortsighted: Companies need to develop strategies which weigh up the resulting risks and opportunities.</p>
<p>avodaq gives advice to companies and develops solutions that are sensible while simultaneously offering security.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<h5>§ 1 General – Scope of application</h5>
<p><strong>1.1.</strong> General Terms and Conditions of Business (GTC) that apply to all deliveries and services of the following companies of the avodaq Group are listed below. The avodaq Group currently comprises avodaq AG in Germany and its subsidiary companies avodaq AG Representative Office Philippines, avodaq Inc. in the United States of America and avodaq Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. When "avodaq" is mentioned below, the provisions apply mutatis mutandis to the subsidiary companies listed or not yet listed here, but which may be added in the future.</p>
<p><strong>1.2.</strong> Depending on the type of service, avodaq AG provides its services on its own or may make use of its subsidiary companies from the avodaq Group. If necessary, avodaq will have recourse to cooperating third party suppliers who then serve as downstream or primary service providers. If avodaq AG acts as the contractual partner, it is the sole authorised and obliged party. This also applies if in individual cases, the accounting is carried out by a subsidiary company, but avodaq AG is the contractual partner. If a subsidiary company is a contractual partner, this will be obvious from the contract and the present GTC shall apply analogously.</p>
<p><strong>1.3.</strong> avodaq will perform its services based on its GTC. General terms and conditions of the customer shall not apply, even if avodaq has not explicitly contradicted them. Other conditions are only binding if avodaq has acknowledged them in writing; the GTC of avodaq shall then apply in addition.</p>
<p><strong>1.4.</strong> In the event of deviations from the mutually agreed text of the contract, the provisions of the text of the con-tract shall prevail.</p>
<p><strong>1.5.</strong> Companies within the meaning of § 14 BGB [Civil Code] are natural persons, legal entities or partnerships with legal capacity with whom business relationships are entered, and who perform a commercial or independent professional activity.</p>
<p><strong>1.6.</strong> Within the meaning of the GTC only company are customers.</p>
<p><strong>1.7.</strong> Third parties within the meaning of the GTC may be both hardware and software manufacturers, cloud providers, cooperation partners, service providers or other natural persons and legal entities who do not become contractual partners between avodaq and its customers, but who may be a necessary part of the establishment of business relationships.</p>
<h5>§ 2 Conclusion of contract</h5>
<p><strong>2.1.</strong> Offers from avodaq are non-binding. The right to make technical changes and changes in form, colour and / or weight is reserved within reasonable limits.</p>
<p><strong>2.2.</strong> By ordering a product or placing an order, the customer bindingly declares his intention to purchase the ordered goods or to execute the order as applied for.</p>
<p><strong>2.3.</strong> avodaq is entitled to accept the contractual offer in the order or order placement within two weeks of receipt. Acceptance may be declared either in writing or by delivery of the goods to the customer or by the actual execution of the order.</p>
<p><strong>2.4.</strong> If the customer orders the goods electronically, avodaq will confirm receipt of the order as soon as possible. The confirmation of receipt does not represent a binding acceptance of the order. The confirmation of receipt may be associated with the declaration of acceptance.</p>
<p><strong>2.5.</strong> The contract is concluded subject to the correct and timely delivery by suppliers of avodaq. This only applies in case that non-delivery is not the responsibility of avodaq, particularly if a congruent covering transaction is concluded with avodaq suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>2.6.</strong> The customer will be informed immediately about the unavailability of the service. The consideration will be refunded immediately.</p>
<p><strong>2.7.</strong> If the customer orders the goods by electronic means, the text of the contract will be stored by avodaq and sent be e-mail to the customer upon request, together with these GTC.</p>
<h5>§ 3 Remuneration, payment, performance protection deadlines</h5>
<p><strong>3.1.</strong> Unless otherwise agreed, the remuneration will be charged by avodaq at the prices generally applicable at the time of conclusion of the contract. Payments are in principle net prices plus value added tax at the statutory rate.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.</strong> The agreed remuneration is binding for four months from the conclusion of the contract. avodaq is entitled to make a price adjustment in respect of the customer, especially if price increases occur due to exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
<p><strong>3.3.</strong> avodaq may invoice monthly. If services are remunerated according to time spent, avodaq will document the nature and duration of the activities and send this documentation with the invoice.</p>
<p><strong>3.4.</strong> The costs of monetary transactions will always be borne by the paying party.</p>
<p><strong>3.5.</strong> Foreign currencies will be converted into EURO according to the official ask price of the relevant currency quoted at the European Central Bank on the date of invoicing, unless the invoice is issued in that currency.</p>
<p><strong>3.6.</strong> All invoices must be paid in full at the latest 14 calendar days after receipt, without deductions. Upon expiry of this period the customer is in arrears of payment.</p>
<p><strong>3.7.</strong> The customer must pay interest on the debt amounting to 8 % above the base interest rate during the period of delay. avodaq reserves the right to prove and assert against the contractor a higher level of damage caused by the default. 3.8. Dispatch to the customer will be at the customer’s expense, plus packing costs.</p>
<p><strong>3.9.</strong> For public cloud services of third parties, the parties agree on a basic fee for any hardware provided as well as the user fees levied for actual use ("on demand"), which are invoiced to the customer monthly / annually in advance or in arrears according to actual use.</p>
<p><strong>3.10.</strong> The customer may only offset or retain payments due to defects insofar as he is entitled to payment claims due to material or legal defects in the service. The customer may withhold payments due to other claims for defects only in proportion to the defect. The customer has no right of retention if the defect claim is time-barred. Moreover, the customer may only offset or exercise a right of retention for undisputed or legally established claims.</p>
<p><strong>3.11.</strong> avodaq reserves the ownership and the hereby granted rights to the deliverables until payment in full of the remuneration owed; proven defects in accordance with § 3.10 sentence 2 will be considered. In addition, avodaq reserves ownership&nbsp;until all its claims arising from the business relationship with the customer have been fulfilled. avodaq is entitled to prohibit the further use of the services for the duration of payment arrears on the part of the customer. avodaq may only enforce this right for a reasonable period of time, generally for a maximum of 6 months. This is not a withdrawal from the contract. § 449 Para. 2 of BGB [Civil Code] remains unaffected. If the customer or his client returns the services, avodaq will not withdraw from the returned services on receiving them unless it expressly declares its withdrawal. The same applies to the seizure of the reserved goods or rights to the reserved goods by avodaq. The customer may neither pledge nor transfer as security assets under reservation of ownership or legal reservation. The customer, as a reseller, is only allowed to resell in the ordinary course of business on the condition that the customer has effectively assigned his claims against his clients in connection with the resale to avodaq and the customer transfers ownership to his client subject to payment. By concluding this contract, the customer assigns his future claims against his clients in connection with such sales to avodaq, who hereby accepts this assignment. If the value of avodaq's security rights exceeds the amount of the secured claims by more than 20 %, avodaq will release a corresponding proportion of the security rights at the request of the customer.</p>
<p><br><strong>3.12.</strong> The customer is obliged to impose the contractually agreed restrictions on the permissible transfer of rights of use for goods and services to the recipient.</p>
<p><strong>3.13.</strong> If the customer does not settle all or part of a due claim at the contractual payment date, avodaq may revoke agreed terms of payment for all claims. Furthermore, avodaq will be entitled to carry out further services only against payment in advance or against security by way of a performance guarantee from a credit institution or credit insurer authorised in the European Union. The advance payment must cover the respective billing period or - in the case of one-off services – remuneration for these services.</p>
<p><strong>3.14.</strong> In case of economic inability of the customer to fulfil his obligations towards avodaq, avodaq may terminate existing exchange contracts with the customer by withdrawal, continuing obligations by termination without notice, including in case of an application for insolvency by the customer. § 321 BGB [Civil Code] and § 112 InsO [Insolvency Code] shall remain unaffected. The customer shall inform avodaq of impending insolvency promptly in writing.</p>
<p><strong>3.15.</strong> Fixed dates for delivery of services should only be expressly agreed in a documented form. The agreement of a fixed service date is subject to the condition that avodaq receives the services of its respective upstream suppliers on time and in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p><strong>3.16.</strong> Travel expenses and fees for third parties are to be reimbursed by the customer on presentation of the supporting documents, if the customer had commissioned these costs in individual cases.</p>
<p><strong>3.17.</strong> avodaq may demand reimbursement of its expenses if additional expenses are incurred due to improper performance of the customer's obligations.</p>
<h5>§ 4 Collaboration, duty to cooperate, confidentiality</h5>
<p><strong>4.1.</strong> The customer and avodaq will each appoint a responsible contact person. Unless otherwise agreed, communication between the customer and avodaq will take place via these contact persons. The contact persons must bring about all decisions relating to the execution of the contract without delay. The d cision must be documented in a binding manner.</p>
<p><strong>4.2.</strong> The customer undertakes to support avodaq, as far as necessary, and to create all conditions necessary for the proper execution of the order in his sphere of operation. Particularly, he shall provide any necessary information and, if possible, enable remote access to the customer’s system. Insofar as remote access is not possible for security reasons or other reasons, deadlines will be extended accordingly; for further impacts, the contracting parties will agree on an appropriate regulation. The customer shall also ensure that expert personnel are available to avodaq provide support.</p>
<p><strong>4.3.</strong> Insofar as it is agreed in the contract that services can be performed on site at the customer's premises, the customer shall provide suitable rooms to avodaq upon request, free of charge and secured against entry by unauthorised persons, in particular for the storage of documents, documentation and data carriers, as well as workstations and work equipment.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.</strong> Unless otherwise agreed, the customer shall ensure proper data backup and provision for loss of data and components (such as hardware, software) that are appropriate to their nature and importance.</p>
<p><strong>4.5.</strong> In the case of service contracts, avodaq is to be notified promptly in writing of any changes to the location of the equipment or systems concerned. If the customer plans to make any changes or additions to the hardware or software included in a service agreement or to their composition, he is to inform avodaq of these plans promptly, so that avodaq can prepare for the changes in good time before they are carried out and, if necessary, offer and prepare an enhanced service. If avodaq does not agree with the measures or if the customer fails to make the notification, the performance obligations of avodaq regarding the hardware and / or software affected by the changes shall cease to apply. This will not affect the service charges to be paid by the customer.</p>
<p><strong>4.6.</strong> The customer must notify defects in writing in a comprehensible and detailed form, stating all relevant information for the detection and analysis of defects. He must particularly specify the work steps that led to the occurrence of the defect and the manifestation and effects of the defect. Unless otherwise agreed, the relevant forms and procedures of avodaq will be used.</p>
<p><strong>4.7.</strong> The customer shall support avodaq appropriately upon request in reviewing and asserting claims against other parties in connection with the provision of the services. This applies particularly to recourse claims of avodaq against upstream suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>4.8.</strong> The contractual partners undertake to maintain secrecy about business and trade secrets, as well as other information designated as confidential which becomes known in connection with the performance of the contract. The transfer of such information to persons who are not involved in the conclusion, implementation or processing of the contract may only be carried out with the written consent of the other contracting party. Unless otherwise agreed, this obligation will end after the expiration of five years from the date the respective information becomes known, but in the case of continuing obligations, not before the end of their term. The contracting parties will also impose these obligations on their employees and any third parties deployed.</p>
<p><strong>4.9.</strong> The contracting parties are aware that electronic and unencrypted communication (e. g. by e-mail) is subject to security risks. In this type of communication, they will therefore not assert any claims based on the absence of encryption, except where encryption has been previously agreed.</p>
<p><strong>4.10.</strong> The customer is aware that messaging using asynchronous media, such as e-mail or messenger services, is not guaranteed to be reliable. A message is always considered delivered when a receipt has been sent by avodaq and has arrived at the original sender. Particularly in time-critical situations, a personal telephone conversation, not an answering machine, with the responsible authority at avodaq is indispensable.</p>
<h5>§ 5 Services</h5>
<p><strong>5.1.</strong> avodaq is entitled to use the third parties or employees of its choice to fulfil the contract. These persons deployed for the fulfilment of the contract are exclusively subject to the directives of avodaq. 5.2. avodaq will provide the agreed services during the normal business hours of the customer and, if necessary and reasonable, even outside these business hours.</p>
<p><strong>5.3.</strong> avodaq reserves the right to make partial deliveries and to issue partial invoices, unless this conflicts with the legitimate interests of the customer.</p>
<p><strong>5.4.</strong> avodaq will provide the contractual services, particularly the access to the software, within its area of control (from the data center interface to the Internet). Disruptions or outages to Internet connections do not lie within the responsibility of avodaq. The scope of performance, the composition, the intended use and the conditions of use of the contractual services are set out in the respective specifications, supplemented by the operating instructions for the software.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) Additional services, such as the development of customised solutions or necessary adjustments, require a separate contract.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b) avodaq may provide updated versions of the software.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c) If the provision of an updated version is associated with a price increase, the customer is granted a special right of termination. If the customer tacitly agrees to the update and / or agrees to it by conclusive action, the special right of termination is excluded.</p>
<p><strong>5.5.</strong> The availability of the services provided is derived from the specifications.</p>
<p><strong>5.6.</strong> In the case of only an insignificant reduction in the suitability of the services for their contractual use, the customer will have no claims due to defects. The strict liability of avodaq for defects that were already present at the time of the conclusion of the contract is excluded.</p>
<p><strong>5.7.</strong> As part of its service provision, avodaq can provide products to the customer through third parties. The corresponding rights of use are granted to the customer by avodaq or directly by the third party. In this case, it may be necessary for the customer to conclude a contract with the third party directly – particularly SPLAs (Service Provider Licence Agreements) and EULAs (End User Licence Agreements) - or to accept its licence conditions; these may be subject to foreign law. It may also be necessary for the customer to procure certain additional software from third parties himself in order to use the services of avodaq.</p>
<p><strong>5.8.</strong> In the legal sense, the customer does not receive guarantees from avodaq. Manufacturer's warranties remain unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>5.9.</strong> The services of avodaq do not include data transfer. avodaq provides its services at the transfer point in the data center used by avodaq.</p>
<h5>§ 6 Handover and transfer of risk</h5>
<p><strong>6.1.</strong> The risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the goods shall pass to the customer on handover; in the case of sale involving the carriage of goods, upon delivery of the goods to the forwarding agent, the carrier, or any other person or institution (supplier) designated to carry out the shipment. The customer must immediately inspect the delivered goods for obvious transport damage and notify the supplier in writing.</p>
<p><strong>6.2.</strong> Unless otherwise agreed, avodaq may also hand over the objects of performance to the customer by electronic transmission or by providing them for download. If the items of performance are made available for download, avodaq will notify the customer of the provision.</p>
<p><strong>6.3.</strong> Insofar as the objects of performance are transmitted electronically, the risk of accidental loss shall pass over to the customer upon receipt at the teleservice provider (provider) commissioned by avodaq with forwarding.</p>
<p><strong>6.4.</strong> Insofar as the objects of performance are made available for download, the risk of accidental loss shall be transferred to the customer on provision and notification to the customer.</p>
<h5>§ 7 Disruption of service provision</h5>
<p><strong>7.1.</strong> If a cause for which avodaq is not responsible, including strikes or lockouts, affects adherence to deadlines ("disruption"), the deadlines will be postponed for the duration of the incident, including an appropriate restart period if necessary. A contracting party shall inform the other contracting party without delay of the cause of a disruption occurring in its area and the duration of the delay.</p>
<p><strong>7.2.</strong> If expenses increase due to a disruption, avodaq may also demand compensation for the additional expenses, unless the customer is not responsible for the disruption and the cause lies outside his area of responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>7.3.</strong> If the customer can (or asserts that he can) withdraw from the contract due to improper performance of avodaq and / or demand compensation instead of performance, the customer will, upon request by avodaq, and within a reasonable period of time, declare in writing whether he will assert these rights or still requires the service. In the event of withdrawal, the customer must reimburse avodaq for the value of previously existing usage options; the same applies to deterioration due to use in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p><strong>7.4.</strong> If avodaq defaults in the provision of services, the compensation payable to the customer and reimbursement of his expenses for each full week of delay shall be limited to 0.25 % of the price of the part of the contractual service which cannot be used due to the delay. The default liability is limited to a maximum of 2.5 % of the remuneration for all contractual services affected by the default; for continuing obligations in relation to the remuneration for the services concerned for the full calendar year. In addition, and as a priority, a percentage, agreed on signing the contract, of the remuneration agreed on concluding the contract shall apply. This does not apply, if a delay is due to gross negligence or intent on the part of avodaq.</p>
<p><strong>7.5.</strong> In the event of a delay in performance, the customer has the right of withdrawal within the scope of the statutory provisions only if the delay is attributable to avodaq. If the customer asserts compensation for damages or reimbursement of expenses instead of performance to which he is entitled due to the delay, he will be entitled to charge 0.5 % of the price of the part of the contractual service which cannot be used due to the delay for each completed week of delay, but not exceeding 5 % of this price; for continuing obligations in relation to the remuneration for the services concerned for the full calendar year. In addition, and as a priority, a percentage, agreed on signing the contract, of the remuneration agreed on concluding the contract shall apply.</p>
<h5>§ 8 Material defects and reimbursement of expenses</h5>
<p><strong>8.1.</strong> avodaq guarantees the contractually owed quality of the services. No claims for material defects exist for an insignificant deviation of avodaq’s services from the contractual quality. Claims for defects also do not exist in case of excessive or improper use, natural wear and tear, failure of components of the system environment, software defects that are not reproducible or otherwise demonstrable by the customer, or damage resulting from special external influences for which the contract made no provision. This also applies to subsequent changes or repairs by the customer or third parties, unless these do not make the analysis and elimination of a material defect more difficult. § 10 applies in addition to damages and reimbursement of expenses.</p>
<p><strong>8.2.</strong> The period of limitation for claims for defects is one year from the beginning of the statutory limitation period. The statutory periods for recourse pursuant to § 478 BGB [Civil Code] shall remain unaffected. The same applies insofar as the law stipulates longer periods in accordance with § 438 para. 1 no. 2 or § 634a para. 1 no. 2 BGB [Civil Code], in case of intentional or grossly negligent breach of obligation by avodaq, fraudulent concealment of a defect and in cases of injury to life, limb or health, as well as claims under the Product Liability Act. The processing by avodaq of a declaration of defect by the customer shall only lead to a suspension of the limitation period insofar as the legal conditions for this exist. The limitation period shall not recommence for this reason. Subsequent performance (new delivery or rework) can only have an influence on the limitation period of the defect causing the subsequent performance.</p>
<p><strong>8.3.</strong> Avodaq may demand reimbursement of its expenses to the extent that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) It acts based on a report where no defect is present, unless the customer was unable to recognise with reasonable endeavours that there was no defect, or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b) A reported disruption is not reproducible or otherwise demonstrable by the customer as a defect, or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c) Additional expenses arise due to improper fulfilment of the customer's obligations.</p>
<p><strong>8.4.</strong> If rights of third parties are violated by the performance of avodaq, avodaq will, at its own discretion and expense:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) Obtain the right to use the service of for the customer, or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b) Render the service in such a way that no rights are infringed upon, or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c) Take back the service, reimbursing the payment made by the customer (minus a reasonable compensation for use), if avodaq cannot provide any other remedy with reasonable effort.</p>
<p>The interests of the customer shall be taken into due consideration.</p>
<h5>§ 9 Defects in title</h5>
<p><strong>9.1.</strong> avodaq shall only be liable for violations of third-party rights due to its performance to the extent that the service is used unchanged in accordance with the contract and particularly, in the operating environment contractually agreed upon or otherwise planned.</p>
<p><strong>9.2.</strong> avodaq shall be liable for violations of rights of third parties only within the European Union and the European Economic Area and at the place of contractual use of the service. § 10.1 sentence 1 shall apply accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>9.3.</strong> If a third party asserts to the customer that a service of avodaq violates its rights, the customer shall notify avodaq immediately. avodaq and possibly its upstream suppliers are entitled, but not obliged, to the extent permitted, to defend the claims asserted at their own expense.</p>
<p><strong>9.4.</strong> The customer is not entitled to acknowledge third party claims before giving avodaq adequate opportunity to defend itself against the rights of third parties in another way.</p>
<h5>§ 10 Liability</h5>
<p><strong>10.1.</strong> avodaq shall always be liable to the customer:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) For intentional or grossly negligent damage caused by it and its legal representatives or vicarious agents,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b) Pursuant to the Product Liability Act, and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c) For damages resulting from injury to life, limb or health that avodaq, its legal representatives or vicarious agents are responsible for.</p>
<p><strong>10.2.</strong> In case of slight negligence, avodaq shall not be liable unless it has violated a material contractual obligation, where the proper execution of the contract is only possible at all by the fulfilment of this obligation, or where its violation jeopardises the achievement of the purpose of the contract, and where the customer can regularly rely on compliance with this obligation. This liability shall be limited in the case of damage to property and pecuniary damage to the contractually typical and foreseeable damage. This also applies to lost profits and lost savings. Liability for other remote consequential damages is excluded. For a single loss-entailing event, liability shall be limited to the contract value; for ongoing remuneration, to the amount of the remuneration per contract year. § 10.2 applies accordingly to the limitation period. The contracting parties may agree on further liability in writing on conclusion of the contract, usually in return for a separate fee. The priority is an individually agreed sum of liability. The liability according to § 10.1 remains unaffected by this paragraph. In addition, and as a priority, the total liability of avodaq for slight negligence from the respective contract and its implementation for damages and reimbursement of expenses, irrespective of the legal reason, is limited to the percentage agreed in this contract. The liability according to § 1 b) remains unaffected by this paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>10.3.</strong> If data or components (such as hardware, software) need to be restored, avodaq shall only be liable for the expenses required for restoration in the event of proper data backup and precautionary measures taken by the customer. In the event of slight negligence by avodaq, this liability shall only be incurred, if the customer has carried out a data backup and precautionary measures appropriate to the nature of the data and components prior to the disruptive incident. This does not apply insofar as this has been agreed as performance by avodaq.</p>
<p><strong>10.4.</strong> §§ 10.1 to 10.3 shall apply accordingly for claims for reimbursement of expenses and other liability claims of the customer against avodaq. §§ 7.4 and 7.5 shall remain unaffected.</p>
<h5>§ 11 Licence and copyrights</h5>
<p><strong>11.1.</strong> The customer must have or must acquire the licence rights for software to be installed during a release upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>11.2.</strong> The customer will familiarise himself with the licence requirements, usage rights and the licence and contractual conditions of the software manufacturers before concluding the contract and will contact avodaq in case of doubt. The customer hereby undertakes towards avodaq to comply with the licence and contractual conditions of the software manufacturers. The respectively valid licence and contractual conditions of the software manufacturers can be consulted directly on the websites of the respective manufacturers. The same applies to copyright conditions.</p>
<p><strong>11.3.</strong> The customer is entitled to use the programmes, drawings, process descriptions and other documents provided to him for the execution of the contract for the contractually intended use. All copyrights and further rights of use shall remain with avodaq, or possibly with the manufacturer. Any use beyond the necessary contractual use, duplication and transfer to third parties is not permitted to the customer.</p>
<p><strong>11.4.</strong> If a copyright arises through the services of avodaq, the customer shall receive a simple, non-transferable right of use within the framework of his business operations.</p>
<p><strong>11.5.</strong> The transfer of ownership, copyrights and usage rights will only take place against the payment of appropriate compensation.</p>
<h5>§ 12 Data protection and data security</h5>
<p><strong>12.1.</strong> avodaq is committed to complying with the legal provisions governing data protection. avodaq shall also impose this obligation on the persons it employs (employees, subcontractors, third parties) to fulfil its obligations.</p>
<p><strong>12.2.</strong> The customer shall conclude the necessary data protection agreements with avodaq for the handling of personal data.</p>
<h5>§ 13 Contractual term and termination of contract</h5>
<p><strong>13.1.</strong> The performance of the contractually agreed services shall be carried out from the date specified in the contract, initially for the duration of the contractually agreed term. During this minimum term, early cancellation is excluded for both sides.</p>
<p><strong>13.2.</strong> The contract may be cancelled by giving a notice period of three months, at the earliest at the end of the minimum term. If this does not happen, the contract will be renewed for another year, unless it has been duly cancelled, giving a notice period of 3 months to the end of the respective extension period.</p>
<p><strong>13.3.</strong> If the contract is concluded for an indefinite period, it may be cancelled by giving a notice period of 3 months to the end of a calendar year. This cancellation is possible for the first time at the end of the calendar year following the conclusion of the contract. An agreed minimum term shall remain unaffected by this termination right.</p>
<p><strong>13.4.</strong> The right to extraordinary cancellation for a significant reason remains unaffected. A significant reason is given especially, if:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a) The customer commits a serious breach of his contractual obligations,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b) The customer becomes insolvent,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c) Enforcement measures have been instituted against him,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">d) An application for insolvency proceedings has been filed against the assets of the customer.</p>
<p><strong>13.5.</strong> Each declaration of cancellation requires written form to be effective.</p>
<p><strong>13.6.</strong> With the termination of the contract - for whatever legal reason - the usage rights and licences granted in the context of the provision of services by avodaq or third parties and the connection to the data centre of avodaq or third parties are barred. Upon cancellation of individual services as well as upon cancellation of the entire contractual relationship, the deletion of all customer data affected by the respective cancellation shall take place after the expiry of 30 calendar days from the effective date of the cancellation. In the case of partial cancellation, the data belonging to the respective service of avodaq or third parties, and upon cancellation of the entire contract, all usage and product data (e. g. e-mails, databases, contents of folders, etc.), shall be deleted.</p>
<p><strong>13.7.</strong> The customer shall secure his data under his own responsibility in good time before the ending of the contract, for example by downloading and / or performing a data backup via his user account on a suitable data carrier and / or the customer server or shall commission avodaq in good time before expiry of the specified 30-day period to perform a backup, against separate payment. Upon request, avodaq will support the customer with the above for a reasonable fee.</p>
<p><strong>13.8.</strong> Due to reasons of the order data processing regulations, there will generally be no further possibility to access this data by the customer after the termination of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>13.9.</strong> avodaq will erase the data and access codes after expiry of the statutory retention obligations.</p>
<h5>§ 14 Final provisions</h5>
<p><strong>14.1.</strong> The customer shall allow avodaq to name it by name as a reference.</p>
<p><strong>14.2.</strong> avodaq shall be entitled to have the contract executed as a whole or in part by third parties, unless the customer expressly objects to this, stating significant reasons.</p>
<p><strong>14.3.</strong> The assignment of rights and claims under the contract requires the prior written consent of the other contracting party. The assignment of remuneration claims by avodaq is excluded.</p>
<p><strong>14.4.</strong> Amendments and supplements to the contract must be in writing, as well as the waiver of written form itself. Written form is only valid if amendments or supplements to the contract are designated as such, laid down in writing and furnished with a legally binding signature by both parties.</p>
<p><strong>14.5.</strong> The place of jurisdiction for a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law is the registered office of avodaq AG. avodaq AG may also sue the customer at his registered office.</p>
<p><strong>14.6.</strong> Should individual provisions of these terms and conditions be or become invalid as a whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. In this case, the contracting parties undertake to interpret and structure the provisions in such a way that the commercial success intended by the void or legally ineffective parts is achieved as far as possible.</p>
<p><strong>14.7.</strong> German law shall apply. The application of the UN Sales Convention is excluded.</p>
